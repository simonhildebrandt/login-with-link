__Login With Link__ aims to be the simplest, most lightweight authentication solution available.

## How It Works

Simply direct your users to our login page, and once they've
provided an email address we send them an email with a login link -
follow that link and they're back at your site, with a [JSON Web Token](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token) embedded in the URL for you to extract and use.

## How's Login With Link different?
Authentication is the most annoying thing to build for any
project - particularly small or experimental ones.
OAuth flows are a hassle, with integration configuration to
setup, test and maintain. Authentication providers like Auth0
or Firebase help manage it, but it's still a mess - when
something much simpler will probably serve your needs.

__Login With Link__ acts just like the 'secure login link' from sites like Tumblr, or a password reset link - as with most sites, all you need to prove you're you is access to your email account.

## Cost?

__Login With Link__ offers a free tier (currently capped at 50 logins per day, to keep our server costs down) - we'll always provide this.

Our __$10 AUD monthly plan__ raises your daily login limit to __10,000__, and includes basic customer support.
